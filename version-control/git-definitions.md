# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control allows us to view the entire history of revisions to one or more files, and merge revisions made by different people.  It is useful because it allows everyone working on the code to travel back and forward to any point within its history.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch allows anyone working on the code to make changes without affecting the master copy.  It is useful so that multiple changes can be made my various people without affecting the last commit of the master code.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit can be described as saving all the changes that were made to the code in the repository.  Since multiple people can be working on the same code, a good commit message will be descriptive and detailed to all the changes that were made.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict occurs when multiple people working on the same code make changes that git cannot understand.  For example, in an edit collision two coders may make changes to the same exact line, thus creating this type of conflict.
